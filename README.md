dump()
====
dump() is a variable dump function for php.
It is geared to the php native var_dump() function in output style, 
but use an improved analyse and presentation for variable value and variable name!

Output:
 - type of variable
 - variable name
 - data type of value
 - value
 - analysis of value data (String length/Array size)
 - Arrays and Object are displayed in tables, which enhance the readability
